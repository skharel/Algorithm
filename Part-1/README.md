## Lecture comments

> L: means lecture video;

> R: means recitation video

1. R1

   - covers O, Θ & Ω analysis
   - Example of Asymptotic analysis for multiple random functions
   - `Important to understand how to analyze; what matters and what can be dropped`

2. L2
   - Covers the model of computation which helps in thinking about what to look for when analyzing cost
   - `cost of algorithm = sum of cost`
   - Algorithm taught: `Document Distance`
     - Applications: find similar documents, detect duplicates and plagiarism
     - Idea: compare documents and quantify the similarity
   - `Important to understand in order to really understand how to compute cost of algorithm`
