## [2. Getting Started](./2)

- [Insertion sort](https://youtu.be/Kg4bqzAqRBM?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb&t=606)
  - Binary Insertion sort - Insertion sort where you find correct position using binary search
- [Merge Sort](https://youtu.be/Kg4bqzAqRBM?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb&t=1485)

## Lecture comments

> L: means lecture video;

> R: means recitation video

1. R1

   - covers O, Θ & Ω analysis
   - Example of Asymptotic analysis for multiple random functions
   - `Important to understand how to analyze; what matters and what can be dropped`

2. L2
   - Covers the model of computation which helps in thinking about what to look for when analyzing cost
   - `cost of algorithm = sum of cost`
   - Algorithm taught: `Document Distance`
     - Applications: find similar documents, detect duplicates and plagiarism
     - Idea: compare documents and quantify the similarity
   - `Important to understand in order to really understand how to compute cost of algorithm`

| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Insertion sort        | O(n<sup>2</sup>)                                  | L3 - 10:05 - 23:40 |
| Binary Insertion sort | O(n log n) comparisons but O(n<sup>2</sup>) swaps | L3 - 11:40 - 23:40 |
| Merge Sort            | O(n log n)                                        | L3 - 24:45 - 39:12 |
